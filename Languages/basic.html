      <p>
        BASIC (Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)[1] is a family
        of general-purpose, high-level programming languages whose design
        philosophy emphasizes ease of use. The original version was designed by
        John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz and released at Dartmouth College in
        1964. They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and
        mathematics to use computers.

        At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom
        software, which was something only scientists and mathematicians tended
        to learn. In addition to the language itself, Kemeny and Kurtz developed
        the Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS), which allowed multiple users
        to edit and run BASIC programs at the same time. This general model
        became very popular on minicomputer systems like the PDP-11 and Data
        General Nova in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Hewlett-Packard produced
        an entire computer line for this method of operation, introducing the
        HP2000 series in the late 1960s and continuing sales into the 1980s.
        Many early video games trace their history to one of these versions of
        BASIC.
