      <h5>Niklaus Emil Wirth</h5>
      <p>
       Niklaus Emil Wirth (born 15 February 1934) is a Swiss computer scientist. He has designed several 
	programming languages, including Pascal, and pioneered several classic topics in software
	 engineering. In 1984, he won the Turing Award, generally recognized as the highest distinction
	 in computer science, for developing a sequence of innovative computer languages.

      <h5>Contribution Niklaus Emil Wirth</h5>
      <p>
        Wirth was the chief designer of the programming languages Euler (1965), PL360 (1966), 
	ALGOL W (1966), Pascal (1970), Modula (1975), Modula-2 (1978), Oberon (1987), Oberon-2 (1991),
	 and Oberon-07 (2007). He was also a major part of the design and implementation team for the 
	operating systems Medos-2 (1983, for the Lilith workstation), and Oberon (1987, for the Ceres
	 workstation), and for the Lola (1995) digital hardware design and simulation system. In 1984,
	 he received the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Turing Award for the development of 
	these languages. In 1994, he was inducted as a Fellow of the ACM.
	His book, written jointly with Kathleen Jensen, The Pascal User Manual and Report, served as the
	 basis of many language implementation efforts in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States and
	 across Europe.
	His article Program Development by Stepwise Refinement, about the teaching of programming, is 
	considered to be a classic text in software engineering. In 1975, he wrote the book 
	Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs, which gained wide recognition. Major revisions of this
	 book with the new title Algorithms + Data Structures were published in 1985 and 2004. 
	The examples in the first edition were written in Pascal. These were replaced in the later 
	editions with examples written in Modula-2 and Oberon respectively.
