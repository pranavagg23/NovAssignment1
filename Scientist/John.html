      <h5>About John G. Kemeny</h5>
      <p>
        John George Kemeny (born Kemény János György; May 31, 1926– December 26, 1992) was a
	 Hungarian-born American mathematician, computer scientist, and educator best known for 
	co-developing the BASIC programming language in 1964 with Thomas E. Kurtz. Kemeny served 
	as the 13th President of Dartmouth College from 1970 to 1981 and pioneered the use of computers 
	in college education. Kemeny chaired the presidential commission that investigated the Three Mile 
	Island accident in 1979.

      <h5>Contribution John G. Kemeny</h5>
      <p>
        Kemeny was appointed to the Dartmouth Mathematics Department as a full professor in 1953, at the 
	age of 27. Two years later he became chairman of the Department, and held this post until 1967. 
	Kemeny ventured into curriculum development when he introduced Finite mathematics courses. He
	 teamed with Gerald L. Thompson and J. Laurie Snell to write Introduction to Finite Mathematics 
	(1957) for students of biology and social sciences. The Dartmouth mathematics department professors
	 also wrote Finite Mathematical Structures (1959) and Finite Mathematics with Business Applications
	 (1962). Other colleges and universities followed this lead and several more textbooks in Finite 
	Mathematics were composed elsewhere. The topic of Markov chains was particularly popular so Kemeny
	 teamed with J. Laurie Snell to publish Finite Markov Chains (1960) to provide an introductory 
	college textbook. Considering the advances using potential theory obtained by G. A. Hunt, they
	 wrote Denumerable Markov Chains in 1966.
