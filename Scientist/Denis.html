      <h5>About Dennis Ritchie</h5>
      <p>
        Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941 â€“ c. October 12, 2011) was an American computer scientist.
	He created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system 
	and C programming language.Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the Hamming 
	Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999. Ritchie was 
	the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007. He was the "R" in K&R C,
	 and commonly known by his username dmr.

      <h5>Contribution of Dennis Ritchie in C and Unix</h5>
      <p>
   	Ritchie is best known as the creator of the C programming language, a key developer of the Unix operating system, 
	and co-author of the book The C Programming Language; he was the 'R' in K&R (a common reference to the book's authors Kernighan 
	and Ritchie). Ritchie worked together with Ken Thompson, who is credited with writing the original version of Unix;
	 one of Ritchie's most important contributions to Unix was its porting to different machines and platforms.They were so
	 influential on Research Unix that Doug McIlroy later wrote, "The names of Ritchie and Thompson may safely be assumed to 
	be attached to almost everything not otherwise attributed."
	Ritchie liked to emphasize that he was just one member of a group. He suggested that many of the improvements he introduced
	 simply "looked like a good thing to do," and that anyone else in the same place at the same time might have done the same thing.
	Nowadays, the C language is widely used in application, operating system, and embedded system development, and its influence is seen in
	 most modern programming languages. C is a low level language with constructs closely translating to the hardware's instruction set. However,
	 it's not tied to any particular hardware -- making it easy to write programs on any machine that supports C. Moreover, C is a high level 
	language with constructs mapping to the application's data structures.
	C influenced a lot of other languages and derivatives as C++, Objective-C used by Apple, C# used by Microsoft, and Java extensively
	 used in Corporate environment and also by Android. Ritchie and Thompson used C to write UNIX. 
	Unix has been influential establishing computing concepts and principles that have been widely adopted.
