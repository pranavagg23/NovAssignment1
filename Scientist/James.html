      <h5>About James Arthur Gosling</h5>
      <p>
        James Arthur Gosling, often referred to as "Dr. Java," OC (born May 19, 1955) is a 
	Canadian computer scientist, best known as the founder and lead designer behind the Java 
	programming language.
	Gosling was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2004 for the conception 
	and development of the architecture for the Java programming language and for contributions to 
	window systems.

      <h5>Contribution James Arthur Gosling</h5>
      <p>
        Gosling was with Sun Microsystems between 1984 and 2010 (26 years). At Sun he invented an early
	 Unix windowing system called NeWS, which became a lesser-used alternative to the still used X 
	Window, because Sun did not give it an open source license.
	He is known as the father of the Java programming language. He got the idea for the Java VM while
	 writing a program to port software from a PERQ by translating Perq Q-Code to VAX assembler and 
	emulating the hardware. He is generally credited with having invented the Java programming 
	language in 1994. He created the original design of Java and implemented the 
	language's original compiler and virtual machine.Gosling traces the origins of the approach to
	 his early graduate student days, when he created a p-code virtual machine for the lab's DEC VAX 
	computer, so that his professor could run programs written in UCSD Pascal. In the work leading to
	 Java at Sun, he saw that architecture-neutral execution for widely distributed programs could be 
	achieved by implementing a similar philosophy: always program for the same virtual machine.Another
	 contribution of Gosling's was co-writing the "bundle" program, known as "shar", a utility thoroughly
	 detailed in Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike's book The Unix Programming Environment.
