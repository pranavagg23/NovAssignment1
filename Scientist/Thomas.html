        <h5>Thomas E. Kurtz</h5>
        <p>
          Thomas Eugene Kurtz (born February 22, 1928) is a retired Dartmouth
          professor of mathematics and computer scientist, who along with his
          colleague John G. Kemeny set in motion the then revolutionary concept
          of making computers as freely available to college students as library
          books were, by implementing the concept of time-sharing at Dartmouth
          College. In his mission to allow non-expert users to interact with the
          computer, he co-developed the BASIC programming language (Beginners
          All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) and the Dartmouth Time Sharing
          System during 1963 to 1964.

        <h5>Contribution Thomas E. Kurtz</h5>
        <p>
          In 1963 to 1964, Kurtz and Kemeny developed the first version of the
          Dartmouth Time-Sharing System, a time-sharing system for university
          use, and the BASIC language. From 1966 to 1975, Kurtz served as
          Director of the Kiewit Computation Center at Dartmouth, and from 1975
          to 1978, Director of the Office of Academic Computing. From 1980 to
          1988 Kurtz was Director of the Computer and Information Systems
          program at Dartmouth, a ground-breaking multidisciplinary graduate
          program to develop information system (IS) leaders for industry.
          Subsequently, Kurtz returned to teaching full-time as a Professor of
          Mathematics, with an emphasis on statistics and computer science. As
          part of the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System, Kemeny and Kurtz created
          the BASIC programming language. The very first BASIC program ran on
          May 1, 1964 at 4 a.m., and neither Kemeny nor Kurtz thought of this as
          a start to something grand. They merely hoped it would help students
          learn something about the computers they were using. The pair made
          certain that their invention was immediately dispersed to the public
          and made no real money from it. Dartmouth College copyrighted BASIC;
          however it made BASIC available and free to anyone wanting to use it.
          The name for the language originated from Kurtz's wish to have a
          simple acronym that meant something as well. Kurtz states that, “We
          wanted a word that was simple but not simple-minded, and BASIC was
          that one.”
