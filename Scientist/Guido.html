      <p>
        While working at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), Van Rossum wrote and contributed a 
	glob() routine to BSD Unix in 1986 and helped develop the ABC programming language. He once stated,
	 "I try to mention ABC's influence because I'm indebted to everything I learned during that project
	 and to the people who worked on it." He also created Grail, an early web browser written in Python
	, and engaged in discussions about the HTML standard.

	He has worked for various research institutes, including the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) 
	in the Netherlands, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the
	 Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI). In May 2000, he left CNRI along with three 
	other Python core developers to work for tech startup BeOpen.com, which subsequently collapsed by 
	October of the same year. From late 2000 until 2003 he worked for Zope Corporation.
	 In 2003 Van Rossum left Zope for Elemental Security. While there he worked on a custom 
	programming language for the organization. From 2005 to December 2012, he worked at Google, 
	where he spent half of his time developing the Python language. In January 2013, he started 
	working for Dropbox. In October 2019, Van Rossum officially retired before coming out of retirement
	 the following year to join Microsoft.
